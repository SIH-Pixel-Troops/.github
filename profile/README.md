## 📖 Project Overview
**SafarSuraksha** is an integrated smart safety solution designed to protect tourists in remote and high-risk areas.  
By combining **Blockchain-based Digital Identity**, **AI-powered real-time monitoring**, and a **unified incident response system**, we aim to ensure safety, trust, and rapid action during emergencies.  

### Key Features
- **Blockchain Digital ID** – Secure, tamper-proof ID for every tourist using Hyperledger Fabric & Smart Contracts.  
- **AI Real-Time Monitoring** – Detects anomalies such as route deviations, inactivity, or entry into unsafe zones.  
- **Panic Button & Auto E-FIR** – One-tap distress alerts with precise location data and automated FIR draft generation.  
- **Authority Dashboard** – Real-time monitoring for police & tourism boards with instant alerts and case logs.  
- **Optional IoT Wearables** – BLE/LoRaWAN tags for safety coverage in low-connectivity regions.
